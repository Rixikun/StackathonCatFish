This is a 4 day stackathon project.
Technology that I tried to learn for this was React Native (used Expo) and additionally used Firebase to work with it.

  - Tinder-swipe animation
  - user signup/login
  - user home page
  - user photo upload
  - user's "liked cats"
  - individual liked cats' profiles
